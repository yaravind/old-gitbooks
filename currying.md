# Currying

* You can call a function with fewer arguments than it expects. What is returned is a function that takes the remaining arguments.

## Partial Application

## Usage

*  When we spoke about pure functions, we said they take 1 input to 1 output. Currying does exactly this: each single argument returns a new function expecting the remaining arguments. 
*  It is one tool for the belt that makes functional programming less verbose and tedious.
