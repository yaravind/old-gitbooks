# Algebraic Data Types


> **How do you model data in FP?: ADT. Using ADT, we model data with logical *ors* and logical *ands***

- ADT's are only data. No behavior at all.
- In Scala, when we hear ADT, it means Sum Type.
- ADT's doesn't feature sub-type polymorphism, but only *combination/composition* of data types.
- In ADT, [structure of the code follows structure of data](https://youtu.be/7b-LsXoAiy8?t=1189).

## Enumerated Types

- All the possible values are enumerated as there are finite set of values. E.g. Seasons, Switches
- `case` *classes* and *objects* are used to define enumerated type
- When defining an ADT, we need to
  - First define the type
  - Second define the domain of the type i.e. all possible values of that type. These valuses are called *value constructors*.
- Example

```scala
//Intoruduce the type
sealed abstract class Season

//Define value constructors
case object Summer extends Season
case object Winter extends Season
case object Fall extends Season
case object Spring extends Season
```
- Pattern matching simplifies the way we work with enumerated types
- It is not always possible to enumerate all possible values of a type, for e.g. `Color`. This is where the sum and product types are helpful.

## Sum Types

- **This or That**
- All the values of a sum type are clearly expressed as a sum of all of its value constructors.
- Sum types provide individual value constructors for each and every value of that type.
- In Scala, Sum Types are encoded by subclassing
-  Examples: Season, Boolean

## Product Types

- **This and That**
- Sometime we can't enumerate all values of a particular type. For e.g. it is not worth to enumerate all possible colors.
- Example

```scala
sealed case class RGBColor(red:Int, blue:Int, green:Int)
```

## "Sum of Product" Types

- Combination of sum and product types. Sum and Product type together make ADT.
- Mostly have nested definitions

## Recursive Types

- TBD: http://tpolecat.github.io/presentations/cofree/slides

## Standard Library

| Intuition | Type | Value Constructors |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Computations that may fail to return a value | `Option` | `None`, `Some` |
| Computations that may return this or that | `Either` | `Left`, `Right` |
| Computations that may fail with an Exception | `Try` | `Success`, `Failure` |
| Computations that may return many answers | `List` | `Nil`, `::` |


## Transforming ADT

- 2 patterns
  - Pattern Matching
  - Polymorphism
- Pattern matching is preferred as you can see all the implementations at one place. You put the pattern matching in base trait.

## Best Practices
- Whenever a new type is defined, we should define higher-order functions for processing it. [Page 8 of Why FP matters?](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf)
