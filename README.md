Functional Programming Notes
=======

This is a collection of my notes and references to articles and books on functional programming. Examples and links are specific to Scala most of the time.

Why FP matters?
--------
When writing programs in a modular way, we divide a problem into sub-problems, solve them separately, and glue them together to form a solution. The ways we divide the problem directly depends upon the ways we can glue them together. Therefore, to increase one's ability to modularize a problem conceptually, one must provide new kinds of glues in the programming language. FP languages provide two new, very important kind of glue: **Higher-order functions** and **Lazy evaluation**.
