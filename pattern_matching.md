- [Pattern matching or OOP polymorphism?](https://youtu.be/S60PiAw-Tg4?list=PLO9y7hOkmmSEmDcxBXvIDp-1b5EIC5Ed5&t=867)
  - Use polymorphism when 
    - new sub-classes are expected to be added in future

    - new methods are expected to be added to existing class hierarchy
    - the behavior is spanning multiple types
- apply, applySeq
